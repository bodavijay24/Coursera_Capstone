Data

To help Srikanth in his search we will need to access following data:

- The Localities of Bangalore, Karnataka from a website : https://www.thrillophilia.com/destinations/bangalore/places-to-visit

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these Localities of Bangalore from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
  - the burger joint venues of the Localities
  - the offices venues of the Localities
  - the high schools venues of the Localities
  - the universities venues of the Localities

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropriate in order to locate the burger joint.
